              Gandhi changed the world in many ways. One way was he won over
              India's independence from the British. Gandhi won independence for
              India by using his non-violent methods. He showed the world that
              using violence was wrong. India loves Gandhi for giving them their
              freedom and independence. One more thing that Gandhi did was tell
              everyone to stand up for their own rights and to also to fight
              against cruelty. Later on Martin Luther King Jr. used Gandhi's
              non-violent methods and he won civil rights for African Americans.
              Using non-violence may be the best way to fight!
